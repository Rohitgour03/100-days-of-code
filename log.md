# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 27, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: solved 15+ problems of the Intermediate Algorithm of Freecodecamp. Learned about some important string methods like String.fromCharCode, charCodeAt.

Also learned about basics of Regular expressions and parseInt() like methods to convert the string to a number.

**Thoughts:** As it was my first day of 100 days of code, I feel awesome and great. I have to work on my productivity.
