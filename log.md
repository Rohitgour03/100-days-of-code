# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 27, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: solved 15+ problems of the Intermediate Algorithm of Freecodecamp. Learned about some important string methods like String.fromCharCode, charCodeAt.

Also learned about basics of Regular expressions and parseInt() like methods to convert the string to a number.

**Thoughts:** As it was my first day of 100 days of code, I feel awesome and great. I have to work on my productivity.

### Day 2: February 28, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Solved remaining problems of Intermediate algorithms. I finished the palindrome project and working on a Roman numeral converter.
Learned more about the Regular Expressions and also learned how to apply them.
Revised and practiced some String Methods.
Learn about conversions of numbers to strings and strings to numbers.

**Thoughts:**  Second day and really felt amazing with solving problems. Although Solving problems takes a little time. But really worth the time and effort.
